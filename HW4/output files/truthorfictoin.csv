Hillary Clinton Sold Weapons to ISIS-Fiction!,https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-sold-weapons-isis/,27,September,2016,13K ,Rich Buhler & Staff, ," WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says emails from Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s private server prove that she pushed weapons to\xc2\xa0jihadists in Syria that ended up in the hands of ISIS.
 
 Given that we couldn’t find emails to back up the idea that Hillary Clinton pushed weapons to ISIS, and a Republican senator directly contradicted\xc2\xa0that claim after visiting Syria in 2013, we’re calling these rumors fiction.
 Reports that leaked emails from Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email server prove that she sold weapons to ISIS started with 
 gave to 
 in July 2016. When asked why he had created a searchable database of leaked emails from Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s private server, Assange responded:
So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have\xc2\xa0published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in\xc2\xa0office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example,\xc2\xa0the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi\xc2\xa0government, which led to the occupation of\xc2\xa0ISIS\xc2\xa0of large segments of that country,\xc2\xa0
. There\xe2\x80\x99s more than 1,700 emails in\xc2\xa0Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.
Assange\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Clinton had sold or pushed weapons to ISIS was repeated by right-wing websites like 
 and 
, but those stories link to Assange\xe2\x80\x99s quote from above \xe2\x80\x94 not to emails that actually prove Clinton supplied weapons to ISIS while she served as secretary of state.
 We sifted through the database of Clinton emails and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find any that indicated Clinton had pushed weapons to Syrian rebels. News reports indicate that the U.S. did begin providing arms to Syrian rebels until\xc2\xa0September 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 nearly a full year after Clinton had resigned from her post as secretary of state.
 The 
 
 on September 11, 2013, that the CIA had begun to ship light weapons and other munitions into Syria \xe2\x80\x94 and members of Congress actually criticized the administration for not doing so earlier:
The delays prompted several senior U.S. lawmakers to chide the Obama administration for not\xc2\xa0moving more quickly to aid the Syrian opposition after promising lethal assistance in June. The\xc2\xa0criticism has grown louder amid the debate over whether Washington should use military force\xc2\xa0against the Syrian regime, with some lawmakers withholding support until the administration\xc2\xa0committed to providing the rebels with more assistance.
Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has pressed the Obama administration to do more to help the\xc2\xa0rebels, said he felt embarrassed when he met with Syrians along the Turkish border three weeks\xc2\xa0ago.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt was humiliating,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an interview Wednesday night. \xe2\x80\x9cThe president had announced\xc2\xa0that we would be providing lethal aid, and not a drop of it had begun. They were very short on\xc2\xa0ammunition, and the weapons had not begun to flow.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\xa6The CIA shipments are to flow through a network of clandestine bases in Turkey and Jordan\xc2\xa0that were expanded over the past year as the agency sought to help Middle Eastern allies,\xc2\xa0including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, direct weapons to moderate Syrian rebel forces.
In June 2016, the 
 
 that U.S. arms for Syrian rebels pushed\xc2\xa0through networks in Jordan and Saudi Arabia had ended up on the black market (and could have ended up in the hands of ISIS) \xe2\x80\x94 but, again, those programs started after Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s time as secretary of state:
The training program, which in 2013 began directly arming the rebels\xc2\xa0under the code name Timber Sycamore, is run by the C.I.A. and several\xc2\xa0Arab intelligence services and aimed at building up forces opposing\xc2\xa0President Bashar al-Assad of\xc2\xa0Syria. The United States and Saudi Arabia\xc2\xa0are the biggest contributors, with the Saudis\xc2\xa0contributing both weapons\xc2\xa0and large sums of money, and with C.I.A. paramilitary operatives taking\xc2\xa0the lead in training the rebels to use Kalashnikovs, mortars, antitank\xc2\xa0guided missiles and other weapons.
The existence of the program is classified, as are all details about its\xc2\xa0budget. American officials say that the C.I.A. has trained thousands of\xc2\xa0rebels in the past three years, and that the fighters made substantial\xc2\xa0advances on the battlefield against Syrian government forces until\xc2\xa0Russian military forces \xe2\x80\x94 launched last year in support of Mr. Assad \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0compelled them to retreat.
So, given that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find emails indicating that Clinton had pushed weapons into Syria or to ISIS, and Corker\xe2\x80\x99s account of his meeting with Syrians at the Turkish border contradicts those reports, and Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tenure as secretary of state doesn\xe2\x80\x99t line up with weapons shipments to Syria, we\xe2\x80\x99re calling this one fiction."
Ford Foundation Donates $100 Million to Black Lives Matter-Truth! & Fiction!,https://www.truthorfiction.com/ford-foundation-donates-100-million-to-black-lives-matter/,26,September,2016,13K ,Rich Buhler & Staff, ," The Ford Foundation has pledged $100 million in support to Black Lives Matter, leading to calls for a boycott of Ford.
 
 It’s true that the\xc2\xa0Ford Foundation has pledged $100 million to the Black-Led Movement Fund (BLMF), a coalition of social justice organizations endorsed by\xc2\xa0Black Lives Matter. But the\xc2\xa0Ford Foundation hasn’t been connected to the Ford Motor Company for more than\xc2\xa040 years.
 First, we’ll start out by providing some background about Black Lives Matter, BLMF\xc2\xa0and the Movement for Black Lives since\xc2\xa0the connections between\xc2\xa0these organizing and fundraising networks can be confusing.
 In July 2016, the Ford Foundation 
 that it would partner with Borealis Philanthropy, Movement Strategy Center and Benedict Consulting to found\xc2\xa0BLMF. In turn, BLMF will serve as a donor network supporting\xc2\xa0the 
, a social justice movement endorsed by Black Lives Matter, according to a foundation blog post:
Borealis Philanthropy, meanwhile, 
 about the goal of\xc2\xa0BLMF at its website:
Rumors about the Ford Foundation pledging more than $100 million to Black Lives Matter went viral after the announcement. The 
\xc2\xa0
\xc2\xa0that Black Lives matter had cashed in\xc2\xa0with the Ford Foundation’s donation \xe2\x80\x94 and, aside from (falsely) implying\xc2\xa0that Black Lives Matter would receive the entire $100 million donation, the report was factually correct. But, as similar\xc2\xa0reports spread across social media and conservative news sites, details started getting fuzzy.\xc2\xa0
a right-wing website,\xc2\xa0demonstrates how that happened in a\xc2\xa0
\xc2\xa0that begins:
Ford just donated $100 million dollars to Black Lives Matter.
The 
 reported: street uprising, Black Lives Matter is increasingly awash in cash,\xc2\xa0raking in pledges of more than $100 million from liberal foundations and others eager to contribute\xc2\xa0to what has become the grant-making cause du jour.
This story (and calls for Ford boycotts that followed it) made three critical errors: it confused the 
 with the 
, it confused the Ford Motor Company with the Ford Foundation, and it confused the Black-Led Movement Fund with Black Lives Matter.
 In reality, the Ford Motor Company and the Ford Foundation are completely separate organizations since the 1970s.\xc2\xa0Henry Ford\xe2\x80\x99s son, Edsel, 
 in 1936 with an initial gift of $25,000. The foundation took in huge bequests from Henry and Edsel\xe2\x80\x99s estates upon their deaths in the 1940s and grew to become the biggest philanthropy in the world at the time.
 Edsel\xe2\x80\x99s son, Henry Ford II, was involved in\xc2\xa0the Ford Foundation up until 1976, but the foundation began selling off Ford stocks in the 1950s and moved its headquarters from Dearborn, Michigan, to\xc2\xa0New York City in the 1960s. Ford II\xc2\xa0resigned over\xc2\xa0the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c
\xe2\x80\x9d in 1976, and no Ford family member has served\xc2\xa0on the board of trustees since. Today, the Ford Motor Company has a separate nonprofit arm,
, and is in no way connected to the Ford Foundation.
 In the end, the Ford Foundation and the Ford Motor Company are completely separate organizations. And the\xc2\xa0Ford Foundation pledged $100 million to the Black-Led Movement Fund, which is not the same thing as\xc2\xa0Black Lives Matter. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and fiction.

UN Backs Secret Obama Takeover of Police-Fiction!,https://www.truthorfiction.com/un-backs-secret-obama-takeover-police/,5,August,2016,7K ,Rich Buhler & Staff, ," The United Nations has backed President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s secret plan to nationalize local police departments.
 
 The UN hasn’t backed Obama’s secret plan to takeover local police departments \xe2\x80\x94 and we couldn’t find\xc2\xa0evidence to prove that\xc2\xa0a “secret plan” like that exists.
 These rumors stem from a 
\xc2\xa0
, a human rights attorney from Kenya who was appointed by the UN Human Rights Commission to research and report on \xe2\x80\x9cthe rights of freed of peaceful assembly and of association\xe2\x80\x9d in the United States in July 2016. One paragraph of Kiai’s lengthy statement drew speculation about the UN backing Obama’s police takeover:
\xe2\x80\x9cThe Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice has provided\xc2\xa0oversight and recommendations for improvement of police services in a\xc2\xa0number of cities with consent decrees. This is one of the most effective\xc2\xa0ways to reduce discrimination in law enforcement and it needs to be\xc2\xa0beefed up and increased to cover as many of the 18,000-plus local law\xc2\xa0enforcement jurisdictions.\xe2\x80\x9d
A website called 
 started rumors that Kiai\xe2\x80\x99s statement meant\xc2\xa0the UN had backed\xc2\xa0a nationalized police force in the United States. In an article 
 under the headline, \xe2\x80\x9cUN Backs Secret Obama Takeover of Police,\xe2\x80\x9d the website reports:
(That quote was from) United Nations Rapporteur Maina Kai on July 27, a\xc2\xa0representative of the U.N. Human Rights Council, who on the tail-end of\xc2\xa0touring the U.S., endorsed a little-known and yet highly controversial\xc2\xa0practice by the Justice Department to effect a federal takeover of local\xc2\xa0police and corrections departments.
The story\xe2\x80\x99s first mistake is that it mischaracterizes exactly what a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial rapporteur\xe2\x80\x9d is and falsely implied in the headline that\xc2\xa0Kiai’s statement amounted to a UN endorsement.
 In reality, a special rapporteur is an independent expert that the UN Human Rights Council has appointed to examine and report back on events unfolding in a country, or on a particular human rights theme. Then, the UN Human Rights Commission reviews and critiques that report and decides whether or not to act on it, according to 
 of the Human Rights Council:
The Commission on Human Rights exercises oversight over the\xc2\xa0work of the experts while keeping in mind that\xc2\xa0the experts are irremovable,\xc2\xa0independent and are immune from legal process
Simply put, a special rapporteur does not speak for the UN;\xc2\xa0Kiai’s statement\xc2\xa0doesn\xe2\x80\x99t amount to the UN \xe2\x80\x9cbacking\xe2\x80\x9d anything.
 
\xc2\xa0explains Obama’s “secret plans”\xc2\xa0to take control of local police departments by issuing a flurry of the \xe2\x80\x9cconsent decrees\xe2\x80\x9d (which\xc2\xa0Kiai endorsed\xc2\xa0in his statement):
The consent\xc2\xa0decrees are already being implemented in Newark, New Jersey; Miami,\xc2\xa0Florida; Los Angeles, California; Ferguson, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois;\xc2\xa0and other municipalities\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0In short, the much-feared nationalization of local police departments is\xc2\xa0already being initiated by the Obama administration’s Justice Department.\xc2\xa0And somehow nobody noticed.
But those\xc2\xa0claims about where consent decrees have been issued\xc2\xa0are misleading, and in some instances they’re false.
 The 
 was issued under Bill Clinton in the 1990s \xe2\x80\x94 not Obama. The 
 was issued due to violations of the Clean Water Act \xe2\x80\x94 it had nothing do with police. Chicago, meanwhile, 
, and the review is ongoing (no consent decree has been issued).
 The story did, however, correctly report the 
 and 
 consent decrees reached under Obama.
 But\xc2\xa0a 
 
 of the number of DOJ investigations launched and the number of consent decrees\xc2\xa0reached over the last two decades don\xe2\x80\x99t support the idea that Obama is secretly trying to use them to create a nationalized police force:
In the past two decades, the Justice Department has\xc2\xa0launched\xc2\xa067 civil\xc2\xa0rights investigations of police departments. Nine remain unresolved.
Of the completed investigations, 24 were closed without reform\xc2\xa0agreements, meaning investigators did not have sufficient evidence to\xc2\xa0prove civil rights abuses or the agencies informally resolved the problems,\xc2\xa0officials said.
In eight investigations, Justice documented patterns of civil rights abuses\xc2\xad\xc2\xa0and won promises from the departments to reform. Those cases were\xc2\xa0settled out of court with no independent or federal oversight.
Twenty-six investigations \xe2\x80\x94 a little more than half of them since President\xc2\xa0Obama took office \xe2\x80\x94 have led to the most rigorous outcome: binding\xc2\xa0agreements tracked by monitors. More than half were consent decrees,\xc2\xa0meaning they were approved and managed in federal court.
In the end, there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be sufficient evidence to prove that Obama is using consent decrees to secretly takeover the country\xe2\x80\x99s police forces. And the UN hasn\xe2\x80\x99t endorsed that \xe2\x80\x94 even though a special\xc2\xa0rapporteur for the UN Human Rights Commission did."
Clinton Researcher Victor Thorn Found Dead-Truth!,https://www.truthorfiction.com/clinton-researcher-victor-thorn-found-dead/,8,August,2016,7K ,Rich Buhler & Staff, ," Prolific Clinton researcher Victor Thorn (also known as Scott Robert Makufka) has been found dead.
 
 Clinton researcher Victor Thorn, whose birth name was Scott Robert Makufka, died of what appeared to be\xc2\xa0a self-inflicted gunshot wound on August 1st, according to his family.
 Victor Thorn regularly published books and articles that were critical of Bill and Hillary Clinton, including \xe2\x80\x9c

 That led right-wing websites to imply that Victor Thorn had himself been the victim of a Clinton death plan days after Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic presidential nomination. However, there\xe2\x80\x99s currently no evidence to support that claim.
 
, a website that regularly published Victor Thorn bylines, 
\xc2\xa0the Clinton researcher and author\xe2\x80\x99s death on August 1st. Thorn died \xe2\x80\x9cat the top of a mountain near his home, the apparent victim of a gunshot wound\xe2\x80\x9d on his 54th birthday, the website reported.
 Thorn\xe2\x80\x99s family said there was no evidence of foul play, and he most likely took his own life. In an appearance on the 
 
, Victor Thorn\xe2\x80\x99s brother, William J. Makufka, choked up while\xc2\xa0talking about the life and death of his brother. When asked how he explained the timing of Thorn’s death, his brother responded:
He absolutely did not like dealing with death and sickness \xe2\x80\xa6 Scott did not want to get old. He was, and we still are and right now, watching my parents who are in their early 80s go through a lot of health issues. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that played a part. It is also my true belief that Scott very much believed that death isn\xe2\x80\x99t the end and we continue on \xe2\x80\xa6 He truly believed his journey was done and he wanted to see what came next.
So, reports that Clinton researcher and author Victor Thorn was found dead on the morning of August 1st are true. But his family has disputes\xc2\xa0the idea that a sinister plot or\xc2\xa0foul play involved."
Muslim Students Question Swiss Handshake Custom-Truth!,https://www.truthorfiction.com/muslim-students-question-swiss-handshake-custom/,13,July,2016,18K ,Rich Buhler & Staff, ," Muslim students questioned a Swiss tradition that teachers can demand handshakes from their students because their religion forbids contact with females that aren\xe2\x80\x99t family members.
 
 Accounts of two Muslim students objecting to the Swiss handshake tradition for religious reasons are true
 In Switzerland, it\xe2\x80\x99s tradition for schoolteacher to shake students\xe2\x80\x99 hands before and after class in a show of respect. After two Muslim students refused to shake a female teacher\xe2\x80\x99s hand because their religion forbids contact with non-family member females, a school district in Basel County granted the boys an exemption that allowed them to refuse shaking all teachers\xe2\x80\x99 hands, not just females ones, in April, 
 
:
On Monday, school officials spoke out for the first time, defending their decision. School\xc2\xa0rector J\xc3\xbcrg Lauener said a compromise had been reached with the students involved, in that\xc2\xa0they also do not shake the hands of male teachers.
\xe2\x80\x9cThey are no longer allowed to shake the hand of any teacher, male or female. For us, that\xc2\xa0addresses the question of discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d Lauener told Swiss public television, SRF
That touched off a debate with the Swiss teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union arguing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe same rules should apply to all students\xe2\x80\x9d and that it was the wrong signal to send since the boys would need to shake hands with peers and colleagues of both sexes in the future lives.
 In May, a regional school board overturned the local school board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to exempt the boys from handshakes and concluded that school districts could fine students about $6,500 if they refused to comply, the 
 
:
Under the decision, teachers at the school can require their\xc2\xa0students to shake hands. Refusal to comply could land the parents\xc2\xa0with a warning, a call to a meeting with school leaders, other\xc2\xa0disciplinary measures, and in the extreme, fines of up to 5,000\xc2\xa0francs as part of standard school policies, the board said.
Sanctions would need to have \xe2\x80\x9can educational purpose and be\xc2\xa0proportionate,\xe2\x80\x9d it said.
So, it\xe2\x80\x99s true that two Muslim teenagers objected to the Swiss student-teacher handshake tradition and were later forced to comply or face a hefty fine."
‘Clinton Body Count’ Rumors,https://www.truthorfiction.com/clintonfriends/,17,March,2015,Not True,Rich Buhler & Staff,"People linked directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton have died under mysterious circumstances, suggesting a massive cover-up.","Stories about mysterious deaths of people associated with the Clintons have been around since the 1990s.
The “Clinton body count” list apparently originated on an Internet site in 1994 run by 
 named Linda Thompson, of the American Justice Federation, a pro-militia not-for-profit organization that is perhaps best known for its 
 about black helicopters, secret FEMA camps, and 
 of the mid-1990s:
Thompson 
, but the nonprofit remains. As of 2017, it is still putting out web documentaries:
The list also remains, and over the years it has metastasized and worked its way into the public discourse in many ways. It even came up in sworn testimony that White House employee Linda Tripp gave to 
 chairman 
 (another 
 who has made a name for himself with decades of frivolous lawsuits against the Clintons, 
) in December 1998.
Tripp testified that a handwritten list of people who were involved with Clinton and who had suffered mysterious deaths ended up on her office chair in the White House, just before the sex scandal between White House Intern Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton became known publicly. Tripp said that the list was accompanied by a note that said, “Linda, just thought you’d find this of interest.”
There is no credible evidence that any of the deaths are related or can be attributed to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Further, some of the descriptions of the deaths are not accurate.
Although is true that some of the deaths on this list had some connection with Bill Clinton, or with someone who was in Clinton’s sphere, and that many of them died violently or by suicide (raising the question of whether their deaths were related and whether any of the deaths can be linked in any way to Bill Clinton), there are many well-known historical events that are surrounded by unanswered questions.
A lack of answers to the questions doesn’t mean that the questions are meaningless or that new facts couldn’t be found.\xc2\xa0 It is easier to come up with questions, however, than to come up with answers, and if we are to come to any conclusions, it should be based on evidence, not just the fact that questions exist.
James McDougal, Clinton’s convicted Whitewater partner, died of an apparent heart attack while in solitary confinement. He was a key witness in Ken Starr’s investigation.
\xc2\xa0McDougal died on Sunday, March 8, 1998 in John Petersmith Hospital in Ft. Worth, Texas. He had been serving a federal prison sentence for fraud in connection with the Whitewater land deal.\xc2\xa0 At first, he claimed to be innocent, but after being convicted of 18 felony counts, he cooperated with Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr’s investigation of the Clintons.\xc2\xa0 He was scheduled to give damaging testimony against the Clintons, although critics of the investigation say his testimony had previously been inconsistent and that nothing new was expected to be revealed.\xc2\xa0 A prison spokesman said McDougal died of a heart attack and had been suffering from heart disease and blocked arteries.
Mary Mahoney,\xc2\xa0a former White House intern was murdered July 1997 at a Starbucks Coffee Shop in Georgetown. The murder happened just after she was to go public with her story of sexual harassment in the White House.
Mary Caitrin Mahoney was murdered over the July 4th weekend in 1997 at the Georgetown Starbucks near Washington D.C. She was the assistant manager and, according to published reports, she and two other employees were working late at night after the coffee bar had closed.\xc2\xa0 All three were found shot to death.\xc2\xa0No money was taken and there was no sign of forced entry.\xc2\xa0In 1999, Carl Derick Cooper was charged with the murders, six armed robberies, and other shootings.\xc2\xa0Mahoney had interned for the White House official responsible for contact with the Asian-American community.\xc2\xa0 TruthOrFiction.com has not found any documentation that she was about to “go public with her story of sexual harassment in the White House” or that her death was anything beyond that of a murder associated with the robbery.
A report in The Washington Weekly explains that journalist Mike Isikoff had written that “a former White House staffer” with the initial “M” in her name was going to go public with a sexual harassment story. Some speculated that he meant Mary Mahoney, and that was why she was killed. Later, it turned out that he was referring to Monica Lewinsky.
Vince Foster,\xc2\xa0former White House councilor, and colleague of Hillary Clinton at Little Rock’s Rose Law firm. Died of a gunshot wound to the head, ruled a suicide.
\xc2\xa0Vince Foster was Deputy White House Counsel and the Clinton’s lawyer.\xc2\xa0 He was found dead in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993. Three investigations into Foster’s death, including one by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, have concluded that the death was a suicide.\xc2\xa0 Critics of the investigations say Foster’s death does not fit the facts of a suicide and that there are a lot of unanswered questions about his death, some of the activities at the White House after his body was found, and the investigations themselves.\xc2\xa0 Although there are numerous theories about what may have happened to Foster and why, none of them has been proven.
Ron Brown, Secretary of Commerce and former DNC Chairman. Reported to have died by impact in a plane crash. A pathologist close to the investigation reported that there was a hole in the top of Brown’s skull resembling a gunshot wound. At the time of his death Brown was being investigated, and spoke publicly of his willingness to cut a deal with prosecutors.
Brown and 34 others died on April 3, 1996 when the Air Force jet carrying crashed into a mountainside in Croatia. The Air Force, in a 22-volume report issued in June of 1996, confirmed its initial judgment that the crash resulted from pilot errors and faulty navigation equipment.\xc2\xa0 Subsequent controversy erupted, however, over autopsy photos.
There is a hole in Ron Brown’s skull which investigators say is consistent with a puncture that could have been caused by debris during the crash.\xc2\xa0 Investigative reporter Christopher Ruddy came forward with an article in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review in which he quoted Air Force pathologist, Lt. Col. Steve Cogswell as saying that the hole was perfectly round shape of a 45 caliber bullet. Cogswell had not actually examined the body. Later, another pathologist, Army Lt. Col. David Hause, said he had been working nearby the Ron Brown autopsy, overheard discussion about the round hole, walked over and looked at it and said it seemed like a bullet hole to him. Air Force Col. William Gormley, the pathologist who actually did the Ron Brown autopsy, said, however, that it is more of an indentation than a hole and that if there had been a bullet, there would have been either an exit wound or a bullet found in the body, and there were not. The Justice Department had opened an investigation into Brown’s financial dealings.
C. Victor Raiser II and Montgomery Raiser, major players in the Clinton fundraising organization, died in a private plane crash in July 1992.
On July 30, 1992, Victor and Montgomery Raiser were killed in a plane crash while on a fishing trip in Alaska. Investigation of the crash by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that it was the result of pilot error.\xc2\xa0 Some “body count” lists have removed the Raisers.
Paul Tulley, Democratic National Committee Political Director found dead in a hotel room in Little Rock, September 1992. Described by Clinton as a “dear friend and trusted advisor.”
His name was spelled “Tully” and he was a top strategist for the Democrats and working with the Clinton campaign.\xc2\xa0 He died of massive heart failure in a Little Rock motel room.\xc2\xa0 There has been no controversy over his death that we could find.
Ed Willey, a Clinton fundraiser, found dead November 1993 deep in the woods in VA of a gunshot wound to the head. Ruled a suicide. Ed Willey died on the same day his wife Kathleen Willey claimed Bill Clinton groped her in the oval office in the White House. Ed Willey was involved in several Clinton fundraising events.
Ed Willey was an attorney who owed the IRS $400,000 and had embezzled nearly $270,000 from one of his clients. Willey’s financial woes were a source of stress between Ed Willey and his wife, Kathleen Willey.
There was a reportedly stormy family meeting about it on the night of November 28, 1993 and Ed Willey moved out of the house.\xc2\xa0 The next day, Kathleen Willey went to the White House to see Bill Clinton about a job; she says the president assaulted her during that same visit.
It was later discovered that Ed Willey had driven into the woods on the same day.\xc2\xa0 His body was found by hunters on November 30, 1993.\xc2\xa0 Authorities ruled his death a suicide by shotgun. There was a suicide note apologizing for the financial problems.
Jerry Parks, head of Clinton’s gubernatorial security team in Little Rock.\xc2\xa0 Gunned down in his car at a deserted intersection outside Little Rock.\xc2\xa0 Park’s son said his father was building a dossier on Clinton. He allegedly threatened to reveal this information. After he died the files were mysteriously removed from his house.
\xc2\xa0Jerry Luther Parks was indeed the head of security for the Clinton-Gore Little Rock headquarters in 1992.\xc2\xa0 On September 26, 1996, he was murdered down while driving through a Little Rock intersection by a lone gunman, who reportedly fired seven shots at him. This took place two months after Vince Foster’s death.
Both Parks’ wife and son have said that they believe Parks was murdered and that he feared for his life.\xc2\xa0 His murder has never been solved. According to Gary Parks, Jerry Parks’ son, the files were on the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton, but they were not removed from Parks’ house after his death.\xc2\xa0 According to investigative reporter Christopher Ruddy, the files that Parks had been keeping on Clinton were taken during a burglary several weeks

Clyde Steelman, the homicide sergeant investigating the murders for the Little Rock Police, told reporters that he did not believe the theories of Parks’ son and wife and that he’d found no evidence of the alleged files.
James Bunch reportedly had a “black book” containing names of influential people who visited prostitutes in Texas and Arkansas. He apparently died by suicide.
We have yet to find any details on this person.
James Wilson was found dead in May 1993 from an apparent hanging.\xc2\xa0 He was reported to have ties to Whitewater.
James
John” Wilson, a popular leader and political figure in the Washington D.C. area and Chairman of the District of Columbia Council, was found dead on May 19,1993. Authorities ruled Wilson’s death a suicide by hanging.\xc2\xa0 According to numerous articles in the Washington Post, Wilson had long suffered from depression and had twice before attempted suicide. We have found no evidence that he had any information about the Clintons or any ties to Whitewater.
Kathy Ferguson, ex-wife of Arkansas trooper Danny Ferguson, was found dead in May 1994 in her living room with a gunshot to her head. Danny Ferguson was a co-defendant along with Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Kathy Ferguson was a possible corroborating witness for Paula Jones.
Kathy Ferguson was found dead on May 11, 1994, five days after Paula Jones filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against President Bill Clinton.She died of a gunshot wound to the head and a suicide note was found. Her ex-husband was Arkansas trooper Danny Ferguson, one of those named in the so-called “Troopergate” cases involving those who had been a part of then Governor Clinton’s security detail.\xc2\xa0 He was named in Paula Jones’ suit.
According to an Associated Press article on May 14, 1993, she was found\xc2\xa0not in her living room, however, but in the apartment of her boyfriend, Sherwood police officer Bill Shelton.\xc2\xa0 The suicide note said, “I can’t stay here any longer. Things will never be the same for us. I can’t take that.”
Bill Shelton, Arkansas State Trooper and fiancee of Kathy Ferguson. Critical of the suicide ruling of his fiancee, he was found dead in June 1994 of a gunshot wound.
31-year old Bill Shelton was a police officer in Sherwood, Arkansas, and was indeed engaged to Kathy Ferguson. It was in his apartment that she was found dead. He was one of many of her friends who felt that Ferguson did not commit suicide, and that the coroner’s report was not accurate about her wound being self-inflicted.\xc2\xa0 He was found a month later sprawled over her grave with a gunshot wound to his head that was similar to what the coroner had described as Ferguson’s wound. That death, like Ferguson’s, was ruled a suicide.
Gandy Baugh, attorney for Clinton’s friend Dan Lassater, jumped or fell out of the window of a tall building in January 1994. His client was a convicted drug distributor.
Gandy Baugh jumped out of a window of a multi-story building and died on January 8, 1994.\xc2\xa0 Published reports say he was defending a man named Dan Lassater in a financial misconduct case.\xc2\xa0 Lassater was an associate of Bill Clinton’s who was convicted of cocaine distribution.
Florence Martin, an accountant and CIA subcontractor for the CIA, was related to an airport drug smuggling case. He died of three gunshot wounds.
This is an interesting one.\xc2\xa0 Many of the “Body Count” lists say Florence Martin was killed in Mabelle, Texas in 1994.\xc2\xa0 That Florence Martin, however, was a 69-year-old employee of a nearby convenience store and a spokesperson for the Baylor County, Texas District Attorney’s office says she had nothing to do with Bobby Seal, Mena, Arkansas, or the CIA.
Suzanne Coleman reportedly had an affair with Clinton when he was Arkansas Attorney General. Died of a gunshot wound to the back of the head, ruled a suicide. Was pregnant at the time of her death.
Still working on this one.
Paula Grober was Clinton’s speech interpreter for the deaf from 1978 until her death on December 9, 1992. She died in a single-car crash.
\xc2\xa0There is no evidence that there was anything criminal about her death.
Danny Casolaro was an ivestigative reporter investigating Mena Airport and the Arkansas Development Finance Authority. He slit his wrists in the middle of his investigation.
Forty-four year old Danny Casolaro was found dead in the Sheraton hotel in Martinsburg, West Virginia on August 10, 1991. His wrists had been slashed.\xc2\xa0 According to an October 14, 1991 
\xc2\xa0story on his death, he had warned friends and family that his life was in danger, saying it was because of what he called “the story of the century” \xe2\x80\x94 but it wasn’t about the Clintons, it was about the Reagan-Bush administration and an alleged effort to delay the freeing of the hostages being held at the time by Iran in order to do damage to President Jimmy Carter’s reelection bid.
Casolaro was told that as a part of that effort, drugs and weapons were being flown into and out of the airport at Mena, Arkansas.\xc2\xa0 Bill Clinton was governor at the time and there have been numerous questions about whether Clinton was in any way involved in any of the activities connected with Mena or protected those who were involved.
Paul Wilcher, an attorney investigating corruption at Mena Airport with Casolaro and the 1980 “October Surprise,” was found dead on a toilet June 22, 1993 in his Washington, D.C. apartment. He had delivered a report to Attorney General Janet Reno 3 weeks before his death.
In his report to the AG, Wilcher said that he was in grave danger and that if the information he had for Reno fell into the wrong hands, there could be people “silenced in the very near future.”
Jon Parnell Walker, Whitewater investigator for Resolution TrustCorp., jumped to his death from his Arlington, Virginia apartment balcony August15, 1993. He was investigating the Morgan Guarantee scandal.
Undetermined.
Barbara Wise, a Commerce Department staffer, worked closely with Ron Brown and John Huang. Cause of death unknown. Died November 29, 1996. Her bruised, nude body was found locked in her office at the Department of Commerce.
According to a report on WRC-TV in the Washington area, Wise’s body was found in a locked office and was partly nude and bruised. The crime has never been solved.\xc2\xa0 There has not been any evidence that her death was related to any of the events involving Ron Brown or John Huang.
Charles Meissner was assistant Secretary of Commerce who gave John Huang a special security clearance; he died shortly thereafter in a small plane crash.
Charles Meissner was not killed in a small plane crash, but was among those killed along with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown in the crash of an Air Force plane in Croatia in 1996.
Dr. Stanley Heard, chairman of the National Chiropractic Health Care Advisory Committee, died with his attorney Steve Dickson in a small plane crash. Dr. Heard, in addition to serving on Clinton’s advisory council personally treated Clinton’s mother, stepfather and brother.
According to the National Transportation and Safety Board, the crash was due to\xc2\xa0“inadequate annual inspection of the airplane and non-compliance with airworthiness directives by company maintenance personnel.”
The NTSB says the airplane caught fire in the air and crashed while the pilot attempted to make an emergency landing.\xc2\xa0 There is no evidence that we can find that links the crash or Dr. Heard to any criminal investigation.
Barry Seal, a drugrunning pilot out of Mena, Arkansas, was found dead after his car had hit a utility pole.
Several books could be written about Barry Seal. He was a danger-loving pilot who was regarded as the best known cocaine smuggler of the 1980’s. He did not die in a car accident, but was murdered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1986 by three men with machine guns who were later arrested and convicted. Authorities say they were connected with the Medellin drug cartel. Louisiana’s attorney general told U.S. Attorney General Ed Meese in 1986 that Seal smuggled $3 to $5 billion in drugs into the United States.
In 1981, Seal began running his smuggling operation out of a highly guarded and, for a while, secret airport in Mena, Arkansas.\xc2\xa0 That airport and Seal’s activities were to become a part of the investigation into the Iran-Contra controversy from the Reagan administration.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been questions of whether Bill Clinton, who was governor of Arkansas at the time, may have looked the other way if he knew about the drug smuggling operation, but there has not been proof of that.
Hershell Friday, attorney and Clinton fundraiser, died March 1, 1994 when his plane exploded.
Saying that his plane “exploded” is misleading.\xc2\xa0According to the NTSB, it crashed, but without any explosion prior to the crash or causing the crash.
 Kevin Ives and Don Henry were known as the “boys on the track” case. Reports say the boys may have stumbled upon the Mena Arkansas airport drug operation. A controversial case, the initial report of death said, due to falling asleep on railroad tracks. Later reports claim the two boys had been slain before being placed on the tracks. Many linked to the case died before their testimony could come before a grand jury.
This is one of the stories out of Arkansas that has a lot of people asking very tough questions.\xc2\xa0 It is a story that is often told, however, as though it has something to do with Bill Clinton, but no Clinton connection has been established whatsoever, especially with the boy’s deaths.\xc2\xa0 The most notable aspect of the event was that the authorities originally treated the boy’s death as an accident, but it was later clear that they had been killed and their bodies placed on the tracks.\xc2\xa0 Some have said the boys innocently found the secret Mena drug trafficking activities and were killed to keep them silenced.\xc2\xa0 Others have said that the boys discovered a local cocaine dealing operation and were killed by drug dealers.

Origin of the Word ‘Spinster’,https://www.truthorfiction.com/origin-of-the-word-spinster/,27,January,2020,True,Brooke Binkowski,"The term ""spinster"" became an epithet thanks to resentment toward women who earned their own way rather than having to depend on a man around the house to bring in money.","The word “spinster” generally conjures up a mental picture of mean little old ladies who have never been married, glaring at young people from behind their living room curtains (which are lacy and yellowed with age, naturally) with their mustachioed mouths puckered in disapproval at all the goings-on outside. At its very least, it is a word that carries connotations of pity.
An 
\xc2\xa0has gone quietly viral since it was first posted, putting the lie to that trope by delving into the origins and history of the term and tracing how it became an epithet. In it, user systlin wrote:
The claim has bounced around social media in bits and pieces for many years, but this particular entry seemed to strike a chord with readers; it was shared on the platform more than a hundred thousand times.
According to the old reliable standby 
, the term did indeed originally describe occupation, and its definition has evolved since it was first used sometime in the 14th century:
The site also offered 
 delving into the word’s etymology, which appeared to back up the original Tumblr post:
The Online Etymological Dictionary also 
 from the work-related origin of the word “spinster” and its later derogatory connotations, pointing out that it was supposed to be exactly the sort of work with which unmarried women were supposed to occupy themselves, at least in England, by the 1600s:
However, there seems to be little historical indication that this was ever a particularly lucrative trade; industries relegated to “women’s work” have been characterized by 
 throughout the centuries. Spinning and carding wool, even for the most gifted women in the Middle Ages, was no different. Which is not to say that it brought in no money at all. Poet and writer 
, who was born in 1364 and became one of the first women in Europe to support herself through her 
, was an early advocate for women’s equality. Medieval researcher and former Queens College professor 
 summed up her 
 in her book 
, which indicated that spinning and carding did not always necessarily pay pittance wages:
That was not the only reference to spinning (and weaving) cloth as a way that women could find\xc2\xa0financial independence. But as with all of history, the true stories are always more nuanced and complex than the claims.\xc2\xa0A 2004 paper by Middle Ages historian 
\xc2\xa0notes that even as textile production became regarded more as a prestigious and skilled occupation, meaning that men eventually took over its distribution and excluded many women from guilds in the process, spinning wool (which was at the time in great demand) remained the domain of the women:
Karras goes on to point out that it is still difficult to parse how much work was done by women on behalf of men, rather than working on their own account:
It is true that some spinners and weavers were recognized as highly skilled, such as a group of women in 15th century London who spun and wove silk rather than wool, but whose experiences as tradeswomen followed 
:
But even though the labor of women, even highly skilled women, was assigned lower value than that of men, it still offered a path to financial independence that lasted cor centuries, but it did not come without a social cost:
But once again, a theme appears in the historical studies of spinsters, one that appears to have been missed by critics of the original Tumblr posts. It’s true that spinning wool (and other textiles) was a stable and lucrative career in Europe during the Middle Ages, and indeed it’s true that it remained so for centuries. Cloth production was regarded as “women’s work,” but eventually it was economically dominated by men who often tried to exclude women from guilds and unions. But it remained an way for women who by choice or by circumstances lived outside of their cultural and social norms to freely choose their own economic destinies and their own fates, relying on their own skills and talents to do so. For many women, freedom from such cultural pressures and the ability to steer their own fate is priceless by their own admission, a sentiment reflected in early writings of the time. The term started be used to describe unmarried women in the 1700s, but it did not become\xc2\xa0derogatory until centuries later, when 
 during the eugenics craze of the early 1900s; by 1903, United States President Theodore Roosevelt was vividly and dramatically describing what he thought of as low birthrates among white Americans as “race suicide”:
That meant that white women (and to a lesser degree, men) who chose to remain single were suddenly regarded as especially suspect, 
 and giving it a whiff of louche disreputability for failing to uphold the white “race”:
Over centuries, then, the term “spinster” went from describing an occupation, to describing an unmarried women, to describing an unmarriageable one, reflecting the social attitudes, trends, and finally the race-based moral panics of the times. At one point, working as a spinster was indeed regarded as a stable and sometimes lucrative profession that was open to women, particularly throughout Europe in the Middle Ages, just as described in the original Tumblr post. While admittedly history is far more nuanced and complex than it is often presented, and while women were still earning less on average than the men who often controlled the means of production, the historical record shows that spinning and other aspects of textile production were considered appropriate and common ways for women to earn a living and support themselves and their households without having to depend on others to do so. Therefore, we rate this claim "

Giant Food ‘Super Spread’ Ad,https://www.truthorfiction.com/giant-food-super-spread-ad/,23,November,2020,True,Kim LaCapria,"In November 2020, Giant Food unintentionally published a ""super spread"" ad for Thanksgiving.","On November 22 2020, a Reddit user shared the following image to

The juxtaposition of the warnings around Thanksgiving alongside Giant Food’s purported use of the phrase “super spread” (to describe a large and appealing array of Thanksgiving foods) led to some confusion over whether the advertisement had been digitally changed or doctored for a darkly humorous effect.

How to Fight Disinformation: Introduction and Overview,https://www.truthorfiction.com/how-to-fight-disinformation-introduction-and-overview/,23,November,2020,,Brooke Binkowski, ,"In 2015 and 2016, new and paranoid strains of political ideology took social media discourse by storm. The details varied by community, but all versions were toxic brews of fear, terror, and lies borne on a torrent of algorithms with the goal of lowering public morale and straining or breaking social bonds.
The algorithmically-charged disinformation and upsetting discussions around it were so overwhelming that it was at first difficult for communities and countries to recognize that they were under attack. In fact, the speed and scale at which 
 spread, generating ripple effects in politics and policies, were unprecedented acts of 
, which tends to focus on information rather than traditional “kinetic,” or physical, battle spaces.
This is a tactic heavily used by 
, and is therefore often analyzed as though it has only been used by them — but although the Kremlin has known expertise in such techniques, they are by no means limited to any one country or entity thanks to the fact that social media has made such techniques extremely simple and relatively cheap to scale, turning the online world into 
:
In an online universe defined by targeted disinformation, we become the unwitting (and sometimes witting) instruments of our own offline destruction — from our individual, compartmentalized lives all the way to up to the international communities. Now, more than any other time in human history, we can see how interconnected we all are — when one tweet may mean the difference between life or death, or stories circulated to just the right people can trigger grotesque acts of ultraviolence.
This is an issue that for the moment is intractable. Our behavioral and personality profiles won’t be going anywhere; our identities have already been gathered, cultured, sliced, diced, manipulated, reassembled into simulacra of ourselves for “
” purposes, and sold to the highest bidders. It won’t be coming back.
This would be a matter of grave concern in any case, but because this technology has been developed opaquely and used against us without our knowledge or consent to bring about specific political goals, it threatens to usher in an age in which would-be 
 with the money and desire to subjugate can distract and upset entire populations long enough to seize power.
A few caveats are in order here. For one thing, this is a very blunt instrument. Social media, which has sold itself to corporations as a persuasion machine, does use sophisticated marketing techniques in order to sway personal decisions — but the tech world’s understanding of humanity is demonstrably so grossly oversimplified that instead of building a persuasion machine, it has built a permission mechanism that allows the worst among us to spread lies, corrosive rhetoric, and suffering, elevating their voices artificially above the rest using algorithms and misdirection.
This is also not intended to take the place of professional analysis nor help for individual psychological trauma. Rather, it is an attempt to distill the at-scale psychological effects of disinformation and propaganda into their corollaries at the individual level for better understanding of how it works — and how to deal with it. And while we are not qualified nor equipped to offer advice for psychological help, we can identify and compare these mechanisms.
These strategies are part of what has come to be called 
, or forming a cultural immune system against disinformation toxicity. Building up institutions — particularly journalism — is essential, but the fight begins at the individual level, which effectively democratizes the response to warfare and threats. In other words, everyone who wants to can fight back:
In this series, we will discuss the different forms of resilience and offer suggestions and solutions for dealing with information warfare and hybrid threats in your everyday life."
Activists Accuse Facebook of Ignoring Warning on Neo-Nazi Groups’ Spread,https://www.truthorfiction.com/facebook-ccdh-walknvt/,23,November,2020,,Arturo Garcia, ,"An activist group combating the proliferation of white supremacist propaganda online accused Facebook in a November 2020 report of failing to act when alerted to the spread of one such network on its platforms in 2018.
“Facebook’s leadership endangered public safety by letting neo-Nazis finance their activities through Facebook and Instagram,” said Imran Ahmed, the executive director of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, or\xc2\xa0
. “This lack of action would not have gone unnoticed by extremists, who now know that Facebook allows them to recruit, organize and raise funds without interference.”
According to the British news outlet the 
, Ahmed’s group released a 
 on November 22 2020 which detailed the activities of several groups on Facebook and affiliated platforms such as Instagram and Telegram, which had gone on to form a network of 61 accounts that had amassed more than 112,000 followers.
According to the report:
The report, which was co-authored by the CCDH and another group, 
, specifically names the neo-Nazi retailer Walknvt as the “most influential element” of the right-wing network and one that was first brought to Facebook’s attention in November 2018. It also included descriptions of some of the group’s “merchandise”:
While Facebook did remove the retailer’s more successful accounts in September 2020, the report said Walknvt rapidly re-established itself on Instagram.
“Walknvt was able to resume its operations so quickly in part because it had directed followers to Telegram, where they were able to receive new instructions on where to view its products,” the CCDH wrote. We can also confirm that the Walknvt 
 account remains active:
Other groups mentioned in the report that remain active on Facebook-related sites include the private group “Christian Identity Truth,” which allows users to join if they indicate that they believe in the white supremacist “two seedlines” take on theology.
“This doctrine posits that only white people descended from Adam and Eve, while Jews were descended from the ‘serpent seed,\'” the report stated.
The group’s introduction page claims that it is “witnessing the message of the Christian Identity TRUTH to those who are stuck in the Judeo-Christian web of brainwashing”:
According to the 
 Facebook began removing white supremacist material highlighted in the report after being contacted by the newspaper. Reached for comment, a spokesperson told us:
Facebook groups have also served as a 
 for inauthentic and violent discourse in the United States throughout 2020. One such group was used as a 
 tool for a group of Michigan men arrested in October 2020 for allegedly plotting to kidnap and kill Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; similar groups were also 
 a series of inauthentically organized protests earlier in the year against public safety measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and were further amplified by domestic fascist groups.

However, the final few paragraphs of the article made clear that the data underpinning the article’s claims was not available for review as of November 23 2020:
Initially, we were unable to locate anything other than The Hill’s article and articles about The Hill’s article. However, it appeared the Harvard CAPS-Harris poll was uploaded to the site later on the afternoon of November 23 2020 [

On page 76 of data from polling done between November 17 and 19 2020 [
], responses were provided to the following question:
The same data appeared in the poll’s full results [
], including the figure indicating 58 percent of Americans polled between November 17 and 19 2020 believed President Trump should concede the election. That information was located on page 19:
Data were organized into a table with five top tabs (Trump Voter, Biden Voter, GOP, [Democrat], and [Independent]), and the horizontal tabs were labeled “Concede” and “Wait.” Results on the table were as follows:

That data appeared on page 30 of the full results, and page 90 of the crosstabs dataset, a label for which read:
Results were displayed as follows:
At first, corroboration for TheHill.com’s “Poll: Majority say Trump should concede” article was unavailable, but the results were uploaded shortly after the page went viral. According to a poll conducted between November 17 and 19 2020, 58 percent of all Americans polled believed that U.S. President Donald Trump should concede immediately. Those numbers were predictably higher among Biden voters and lower among Trump voters. Independent voters were only slightly less likely to say Trump should concede, at 56 percent."
"Pok\xc3\xa9mon Creator Admits Game is Anti-Christian, Created for Satanists-Fiction!",https://www.truthorfiction.com/pokemon-creator-admits-game-anti-christian-created-satanists/,13,July,2016,18K ,Rich Buhler & Staff, ," An interview with Pokemon creator Satoshi Tajiri in which he admits he created the game as a backlash against his Christian parents went viral amid the success of the game,\xc2\xa0
 Go.
 
 isn\xe2\x80\x99t anti-Christian, and the game wasn\xe2\x80\x99t originally created for Satanists.
Those rumors started after an old, satirical interview with\xc2\xa0
creator Satoshi Tajiri resurfaced after the release of Pokemon Go in July 2016.
 The fake interview, which appeared at the video game news site 
 under the headline \xe2\x80\x9c
Creator Admits Games are Anti-Christian, Aimed Towards Satanists,\xe2\x80\x9d includes excerpts from a fictional 
 magazine 
:
Time: What inspired you to start making the Pok\xc3\xa9mon games?
Tajiri: Well, my parents were Christians. I grew up being taught the ways\xc2\xa0of that religion. When I got older, I started to realize that the things they\xc2\xa0said were foolish and I guess I rebelled a little.
Time: How did you rebel?
Tajiri: I started to argue against their teachings. They tried to punish me in\xc2\xa0various ways to try to get me under control, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. This is when\xc2\xa0I was inspired by nature and started the basis for the Pok\xc3\xa9mon games.
Time: Could you explain how your parent\xe2\x80\x99s religion is connected with the\xc2\xa0games?
Tajiri: Well, when I got old enough, I wanted to do something that would\xc2\xa0show the world that my parents were wrong. Something I saw in nature\xc2\xa0was the concept of evolution which my parents vehemently denied existed.\xc2\xa0This sparked the idea for a game that would go against everything my\xc2\xa0parents believed in.
Time: This game being Pok\xc3\xa9mon, correct?
Tajiri: Yes. Pok\xc3\xa9mon is essentially the correct answer towards life, not\xc2\xa0Christianity. Everything presented in the game is the opposite of what\xc2\xa0Christians may believe. Some have said that the game promotes voodoo\xc2\xa0or magic, and I agree in the sense that there are many things that occur in\xc2\xa0nature that are unexplainable. Furthermore, the violence in the games is\xc2\xa0unparalleled. It may not show up in the actual graphics, but the brutality is\xc2\xa0made especially explicit in the Pok\xc3\xa9dex entries. Nature, again, played a big\xc2\xa0role.
Time: So those who say that the game is anti-Christian are correct?
Tajiri: I suppose so. I mean, some could say that the game supports\xc2\xa0Satanism. I don\xe2\x80\x99t officially celebrate it, but I can understand why people\xc2\xa0would be attracted to it.
In reality, that interview never took place and\xc2\xa0
reator never said the game was anti-Christian or was geared toward Satanists. He did, however, sit down for a real interview with 
 in 1999 and 
 about the game\xe2\x80\x99s inspiration, which was Tajiri\xe2\x80\x99s fascination with collecting bugs:
TIME:\xc2\xa0Did you get the idea for Pok\xc3\xa9mon from these insects?
Tajiri:\xc2\xa0Yes. Places to catch insects are rare because of urbanization. Kids play\xc2\xa0inside their homes now, and a lot had forgotten about catching insects. So had I.\xc2\xa0When I was making games, something clicked and I decided to make a game\xc2\xa0with that concept. Everything I did as a kid is kind of rolled into one–that’s what\xc2\xa0Pok\xc3\xa9mon is. Playing video games, watching TV, Ultraman with his capsule\xc2\xa0monsters–they all became ingredients for the game.
Tajiri rarely gives media interviews, and we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find any evidence of him talking about Christianity or Satanism."
President Obama Will Refuse to Leave Office if Trump is Elected-Fiction!,https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-will-refuse-leave-office-trump-elected/,26,September,2016,2K ,Rich Buhler & Staff, ," President Obama said he’ll\xc2\xa0refuse to leave office if Donald Trump is elected president.

The\xc2\xa0current president claims\xc2\xa0he is \xe2\x80\x9cfully\xc2\xa0prepared\xe2\x80\x9d to ignore the popular vote if it\xc2\xa0means stopping Trump, having found what he\xc2\xa0believes is a little known loophole that would\xc2\xa0allow him to remain in charge until a re-election is called.
\xe2\x80\x9cAs president, I must do what I feel is in the\xc2\xa0best interests of our nation,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\xc2\xa0the American people elected \xe2\x80\x98the Donald\xe2\x80\x99 then\xc2\xa0I will be forced to take whatever actions I\xc2\xa0deem necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d
